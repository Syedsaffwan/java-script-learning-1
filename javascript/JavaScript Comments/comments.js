//JavaScript comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. They are completely ignored by JavaScript engines.

//There are two ways to add comments to code:

// - Single Line Comments
//* */ -Multi-line Comments
//Single Line Comments
//In JavaScript, any line that starts with // is a single line comment. For example,

//name = "Jack";

// printing name on the console
//console.log("Hello " + name);
//Run Code
//Here, // printing name on the console is a comment.

//You can also use single line comment like this:

//name = "Jack";

//console.log("Hello " + name);  // printing name on the console
//Run Code
//Multi-line Comments
//In Javascript, any text between /* and */ is a multi-line comment. For example,

/* The following program contains the source code for a game called Baghchal. 

Baghchal is a popular board game in Nepal where two players choose either sheep or tiger. It is played on a 5x5 grid.

For the player controlling the tiger to win, they must capture all the sheep. There are altogether 4 tigers on the board.

For the sheep to win, all tigers must be surrounded and cornered so that they cannot move. The player controlling the sheep has 20 sheep at his disposal.
*/
//Since the rest of the source code will be used to implement the rules of the game, the comment above is a good example where you might use a multi-line comment.
