//The const keyword was also introduced in the ES6(ES2015) version to create constants. For example,

//const x = 5;
//Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.

//const x = 5;
//x = 10;  // Error! constant cannot be changed.
//console.log(x)
// Simply, a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

//Also, you cannot declare a constant without initializing it. For example,

//onst x;  // Error! Missing initializer in const declaration.
//x = 5;
//console.log(x)
//
